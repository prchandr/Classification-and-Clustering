# Classification-and-Clustering
ENEE436 Project 2

#Dependencies
In order to run these programs, make sure you have Numpy, Scipy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and mlxtend installed. Numpy and Scikit-learn are used for the machine learning and classification. Matplotlib and mlxtend are used create plots and plot the decision boundaries. Scikit is used for importing the .mat data files.

Make sure mlxtend is installed before running svm.py or neuralNet.py. Ensure that the dataset files are in a folder called "data" in the same directory as the python program.

#How to run
Each program can be run through the command line with
> python <program_name>.py
